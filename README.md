# Content Performance Dashboard
![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Streamlit-orange)

This is a streamlined dashboard for visualizing weekly performance across Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms.

I built this to replace messy spreadsheets for our small media business.

It helped us quickly identify what was working, what was not working, and where to focus next.

It was much more readable and accessible for all members of our team.

- 🛠️ Built with: Python • Streamlit •  Plotly

- Used by a media startup to monitor performance on pages with 45M+ total views.

## Features

-  **Multi-Platform Analysis**: Upload weekly `.csv` exports from Facebook, TikTok, and others  
-  **Weekly Metrics Comparisons**: Compare engagement over time with line and bar charts  
-  **Highlights and Compares Top Performing Posts**: Highlights the week’s 5 best posts  
-  **Hosted By Streamlit For Accessiblity**
